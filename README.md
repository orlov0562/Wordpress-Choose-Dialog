# Wordpress-Choose-Dialog
Plugin that shows how to bind to input your own post/category select popup

I developed it for one of my project and decided to keep first version here to reuse it in future.

To test this functionality do next:
- put "post_choose_dialog" folder into /wp-content/plugins/
- activate it through Admin->Plugins
- go to Admin->Post Choose Dialog
- click on any of text input
- if it fit your requirements discovery code :)
